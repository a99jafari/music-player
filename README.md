# Music Player

This player is developed using HTML, CSS and pure JavaScript (Vanilla JS). I tried to do the best practices and produce clean codes as much as I can. I think this project will be useful and informative for the junior and mid-level developers and also those who are learning JavaScript and want to have a better understanding of behind-the-scenes JavaScript. If you like, you can cooperate in developing this project and adding new features or refactoring codes.
